## Architecture

This is a client-only solution that uses local storage to save your state.

## Roadmap

- **User authentication**: This was not covered due to time restrictions and using a serverless environment. There are plans to use [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) to enable user authentication on a client-only application.
- **Responsive Design**: Heavier, smarter usage of grid and flexbox to create a responsive design.
- **Robust Tables**: Allow for sorting, pagination, and other UX friendly features.
