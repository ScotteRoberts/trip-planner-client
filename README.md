# Trip Planner

## Setup

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Please refer to the [Create React App Readme](./CreateReactApp.md) for more information on how to use this project.

### `.env` in Development

Additionally, this solution uses a `.env` file to store sensitive data. Rename the `.env.EXAMPLE` file in your development environment and provide it with a token string to enable persistent storage.

### `.env` in Production

In your hosting service, you will need to provide these environment variables. This solution is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and uses their method of environment variable injection.
